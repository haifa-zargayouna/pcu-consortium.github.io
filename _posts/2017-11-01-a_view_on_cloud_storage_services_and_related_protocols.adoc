excerpt: A view on Cloud Storage Services and related protocols
---

The goal of this paper is to identify the common storage concerns in a cloud environment.

By listing the major Cloud storage services and the used protocols, we expect to have an idea of which type of connectors which should provide.

== Crawling use cases

=== File System (sync or file server)

In this case, the vendor solution will expose the files in a local computer (desktop, server). using one of the two following methods:

- A synchronization agent: This local daemon manages to synchronize the files in a local location.
- Using a file sharing service: The files are served using a common file protocol (NFS, CIFS).

The crawling process is done by browsing the directories using the standard file crawler.

Who ? Dropbox, Box, GoogleDrive, Microsoft OneDrive, OwnCloud, ...

=== Object storage

The files are exposed by a documented API. Some vendors may provide client implementations.
The API can be standard (S3, SWIFT, HDFS) or proprietary.

The crawling process only differ from the standard file crawler by calling an API to list the files and collect the content.

Who ? Rackspace, OpenStack, AmazonS3, ...

=== Backup & vault storage

This kind of storage provides really specific API. First, the files are not directly visible. What is exposed first are backup entities (archives).

Most of the time, the access to the files is a slow (and complex) process.

The crawling of those archives may be useful to index old data. However, it would probably more interesting to crawl the files before they enter the vault.
